# FeefoTest2

In line with the requirements, I have provided implementations for both **Problem 1** and **Problem 2** as well as full Unit testing for both solutions. The code has been written in a way that closely resembles the Java examples in the requirements as that is what was asked for, I have added a few small embellishments to aid clarity and readability.

![Problem 2](Problem2.png?raw=true)

**PLEASE NOTE**

I want to make it really clear that, by design, all solutions (including the sorting of an `int[]`) have been written manually in keeping with the scope of this exercise. 

I have made the assumption that performance is not a concern here in favour of the mechanics of the logic being evident. 

As such you will **NOT** find any `.NET` library methods or the use of `LINQ` for sorting, counting or performing more complex math than arithmetic.
